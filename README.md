# PopOS Theme switcher for VSCode

Automaticly switches between dark and light mode when system dark mode is toggled in [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/) appearance settings.
This extension is dependent on [Pop Theme](https://github.com/ArtisanByteCrafter/VSCodePopTheme) and is designed to
create uniformity with the Pop!_OS desktop.
